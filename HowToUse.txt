How to map randomize your pokemon heart gold or soul silver roms:

1) Put desired rom to randomize in \heartgold_rom or \soulsilver_rom depending on version. 
   This will only need to be done once.

2) Run "map_randomizer.exe" 
   This will randomize every rom in the \heartgold_rom or \soulsilver_rom folders, though it will not modify them directly.
   If randomization fails, please try doing roms one at a time instead.

3) Your randomized rom(s) will appear in \randomized_roms, along with a log file(s). 
   Roms in this folder may be overwritten if the randomizer is run again, so be sure to move them outside this folder.
