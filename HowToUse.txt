How to map randomize your pokemon heart gold or soul silver roms:

1) Put desired rom to randomize in \heartgold_rom or \soulsilver_rom depending on version. 
   This will only need to be done once.
   If these folders are missing, you downloaded the source code. Please download the release version instead.

2) Run "map_randomizer.exe" 
   This will randomize every rom in the \heartgold_rom or \soulsilver_rom folders, though it will not modify them directly.
   If randomization fails, please try doing roms one at a time instead.

3) Your randomized rom(s) will appear in \randomized_roms, along with a log file(s). 
   Roms in this folder may be overwritten if the randomizer is run again, so be sure to move them outside this folder.
